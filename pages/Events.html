                Every 4 years or so an International Plant Protection Congress (IPPC) brings together plant protection
                specialists from
                around the world to discuss the science and practice of plant protection. It was in 1946 that the first
                IPPC was held,in
                <a href="" class="blue-a" style="text-decoration: underline;">Louvain, Belgium</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prime focus of Congresses through to 1975 was on new means of controlling insects, with some
                discussion relating to
                the chemical control of diseases. Most participants at those early IPPCs were entomologists. The
                Congress held in
                Washington, DC in 1979 was the first IPPC organized by a multidisciplinary group, consisting of plant
                pathologists,
                entomologists, weed scientists, nematologists and chemists; the integration of these disciplines was
                reflected in the
                program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 1979 the IPPCs have been broadly multidisciplinary with an emphasis on an integrated approach to
                plant protection.
                Thus, for over 50 years the IPPCs have provided a forum for plant protection scientists to communicate
                and discuss
                important problems and new discoveries related to crop losses due to pests and their management.
