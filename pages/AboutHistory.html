            <p>
                At the first International Plant Protection Congress (IPPC) in Louvain, Belgium, 1946, Dr Olof Ryberg of
                Malmo, Sweden
                gave an address to the Congress in which he stated –
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                “The world….needs an international organization for plant protection, not only ….to plan coming
                congresses….but to a
                much greater extent to take care of the current work on international plant protection questions.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr Ryberg observed that the activities of the new organization should become multifarious and that it
                should give
                attention to important global crop protection problems/issues, publish a regular newsletter and a
                year-book to summarize
                important events in crop protection, and develop a working relationship with the United Nations.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it took 50 years before a Standing Committee (SC) of the IPPCs established a Future Directions
                Committee (FDC)
                in 1995, charged with examining and elaborating upon the goals and objectives of the IPPC and
                recommending
                organizational/structural changes necessary to meet the communication and integration needs and
                challenges of the plant
                protection sciences for the 21st century and beyond. <strong>Among the many recommendations made by the
                    FDC (and
                    subsequently
                    approved by the SC) was the establishment of the International Association for the Plant Protection
                    Sciences (IAPPS).</strong>
