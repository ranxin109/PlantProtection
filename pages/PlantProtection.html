            <h3>What is Plant Protection and why is it so important?</h3>
            <p>Ever since humans have relied on planted crops as the main source of food, plant diseases, insects,
                rodents, weeds and
                other pest* organisms have been a constant threat to food supply.</p>
            <p><strong>*The term ‘pest’ is used throughout this website to refer to all biotic agents that cause
                    diseases of crops and other
                    valued plants, insects, plant-parasitic nematodes, mites and vertebrates that feed upon them, and
                    weeds that compete
                    with them.</strong></p>
            <p>The biblical locust plagues, the potato blight epidemic that killed millions of people in Ireland in the
                1850s, and the
                complex of pests that have attacked rice crops throughout Asia for thousands of years are just some
                examples of the
                devastation that pests can cause. More recently, while estimates of potential global losses due to
                insect and vertebrate
                pests, diseases and weeds varies from crop to crop, it has been estimated that these pests possibly
                destroy up to 40% of
                the world’s production of food by reducing crop yield and causing losses in storage.</p>

            <h3>The process of plant protection</h3>
            <p>A fundamentally important starting point for plant protection is the ability to anticipate the emergence
                and spread of
                noxious organisms and to prevent their introduction and spread before they become agricultural pests in
                specific crops
                and regions. In this regard, international biosecurity measures and rapid and efficient sharing of
                information across
                continents and countries becomes of paramount importance for preventing new invasions.</p>
            <p>
                In dealing with existing problems, the various steps in plant protection are quite similar to those of
                human medicine.
                The first step is to ensure a correct diagnosis of a problem has been made, which involves a proper
                identification of
                the organisms responsible for the damage symptoms observed. The legacy of classic taxonomy, anchored on
                world-wide
                collections of invertebrates, micro-organisms and plant collections, is the primary resource base for
                comparing
                collected specimens with referenced ones. Modern information technology and biotechnological tools have
                allowed the
                development of modern and time-saving field and lab identification tools for known threats which can be
                detected before
                they invade new areas.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p><strong>The second step</strong> is to assess the extent of the damage and the yield or revenue loss
                likely to result from
                this damage,
                which enables the grower to make informed decisions on whether to invest resources in combating the
                pest.</p>
            <p>
                If the farmer decides to take action to reduce pest attack, <strong>the third step</strong> is to
                consider the various
                options available
                for controlling pests, including host plant resistance, cropping system and cultivation practices that
                reduce pest
                populations, the conservation and introduction of antagonistic organisms, such as parasites and
                predators of pests, and
                active interventions through the application of chemically- or biologically-based pesticides.
            </p>
            <p>The importance of adopting such a broad approach to plant protection research and practice has been
                recognised for some
                time, at least since the 1950s. It is known as <a class="blue-a">Integrated Pest Management or IPM.</a>
